# Project Documentation Repository
   This directory serves as the central repository for project documentation.
   Below is a brief description of the purpose of each subdirectory:

## changelog
   Contains release notes for each version,
   documenting new features, bug fixes, and changes.

## extlibs
   Contains miscellaneous documentary information and
   administrative files related to third-party dependencies
   rather than functional documentation.

## for_ai
   This folder contains machine-readable documents
   specifically optimized for AI processing and natural language model consumption.

   * Priority: Human readability and convenience are secondary considerations.
